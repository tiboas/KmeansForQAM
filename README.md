## K-means clustering for QAM signals
This notebook introduces the use of K-means clustering for QAM signals under different distortions. Issues with convergence is discussed and demonstrated. A simple example of how to apply knowledge about the system to aid the convergence of the algorithm and avoid converging to erroneous solutions.
